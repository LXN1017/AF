AST_CNN: the architecture of the AST-CNN

DN-PSD (jointly training): the architecture of the DN-PSD with the loss functions L_DNPSD and L_class opimized jointly (same as the manuscript of JBHI).

DN-PSD (seperatly training): the architecture of the DN-PSD with the loss functions L_DNPSD and L_class opimized separately (it is easier to follow).

Phase: get the phase representation of a video

Please note that there is no traning and testing data.

Please note that you can divide the traning samples into mini-batches and feed them into the model separately, if your computer do not has sufficient memories.
